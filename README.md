Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Why is Requirement Analysis Important? -clear Understanding of User Needs, reduces Development Costs and Time, Improves System Quality and Success Rate
Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.-## Key Activities in Requirement Engineering

Requirement Engineering involves several key activities that ensure software requirements are properly gathered, understood, documented, analyzed, and validated. These activities form the foundation for successful system development.

1. Requirement Gathering
- This is the initial stage where information about the system is collected from stakeholders, users, and other sources.  
- It focuses on understanding what the users need and expect from the system.  
- Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and reviewing existing documentation.

2. Requirement Elicitation
- This activity involves exploring and refining the gathered information to uncover the true needs of users.  
- It helps identify hidden, conflicting, or unclear requirements.  
- Common techniques include brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and use case development.

3. Requirement Documentation
- Once requirements are clearly understood, they are documented in a structured format such as a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.  
- Documentation provides a reference for designers, developers, and testers throughout the project.  
- It ensures consistency and serves as an agreement between stakeholders and the development team.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- This step focuses on examining and organizing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and consistent.  
- Modeling techniques like **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**, **Use Case Diagrams**, and **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** are used to visualize and analyze the system.  
- It helps identify system boundaries, dependencies, and possible design solutions.

5. Requirement Validation
- Validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the userâ€™s needs and business objectives.  
- It involves reviewing, testing, and verifying requirements with stakeholders to detect errors or ambiguities early.  
- Common methods include walkthroughs, inspections, and prototyping.
