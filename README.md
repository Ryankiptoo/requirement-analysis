Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Why is Requirement Analysis Important? -clear Understanding of User Needs, reduces Development Costs and Time, Improves System Quality and Success Rate
Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.-## Key Activities in Requirement Engineering

Requirement Engineering involves several key activities that ensure software requirements are properly gathered, understood, documented, analyzed, and validated. These activities form the foundation for successful system development.

1. Requirement Gathering
- This is the initial stage where information about the system is collected from stakeholders, users, and other sources.  
- It focuses on understanding what the users need and expect from the system.  
- Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, observation, and reviewing existing documentation.

2. Requirement Elicitation
- This activity involves exploring and refining the gathered information to uncover the true needs of users.  
- It helps identify hidden, conflicting, or unclear requirements.  
- Common techniques include brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and use case development.

3. Requirement Documentation
- Once requirements are clearly understood, they are documented in a structured format such as a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.  
- Documentation provides a reference for designers, developers, and testers throughout the project.  
- It ensures consistency and serves as an agreement between stakeholders and the development team.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- This step focuses on examining and organizing requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and consistent.  
- Modeling techniques like **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**, **Use Case Diagrams**, and **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** are used to visualize and analyze the system.  
- It helps identify system boundaries, dependencies, and possible design solutions.

5. Requirement Validation
- Validation ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the userâ€™s needs and business objectives.  
- It involves reviewing, testing, and verifying requirements with stakeholders to detect errors or ambiguities early.  
- Common methods include walkthroughs, inspections, and prototyping.
Types of Requirements
## Functional vs Non-functional Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional** requirements. Both are essential for building a complete and successful system, but they focus on different aspects of the software.

### Functional Requirements
- Define **what the system should do**.  
- Describe the **features, functions, and operations** that the system must perform.  
- They are usually derived directly from user needs and business goals.  
- Examples:
  - The system should allow users to log in using a username and password.  
  - The system should generate a monthly sales report.  
  - The system should allow customers to make online payments.

### Non-functional Requirements
- Define **how the system should perform** rather than what it does.  
- Focus on the **quality attributes** of the system such as performance, usability, reliability, and security.  
- They ensure that the system runs efficiently and provides a good user experience.  
- Examples:
  - The system should load the dashboard within 3 seconds.  
  - The system should be available 99.9% of the time.  
  - The system should encrypt all user data for security.

### Summary Table

| Aspect | Functional Requirements | Non-functional Requirements |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Focus  | What the system does | How the system performs |
| Type   | Functional features and behaviors | Quality attributes and performance standards |
| Example | Login, search, report generation | Speed, security, scalability |
| Measured By | Correctness of output | Quality metrics and benchmarks |
